			<p>For this assignment, I added Highcharts to the DGS Overview page found <a href="https://uofu-cs4540-77.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/Projects/Grad_Progress/DGS/overview.php">here</a> to make the page easier to read and display more data.</p>

			<p>I believe my work should receive a superior grade because:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>I have three charts that display different information for the DGS:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>The first chart displays the GPA distribution of the students in a column chart.</li>
					<li>The second chart displays how many students each advisor has in a line chart.</li>
					<li>The third chart displays how many activities each student has completed in a pie chart.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>All of the charts use AJAX to receive the information to populate the chart. When a user selects a different chart, an AJAX call is made to a PHP function that queries the database.</li>
				<li>The use of AJAX allows the DGS to be able to switch between charts without having to reload the page every time the DGS switches charts.</li>
				<li>The use of the charts allows the DGS to be able to view information about the students and advisors without having to pull up individual records or having to compute the information themselves.</li>
				<li>The way I incorporated AJAX with the charts makes it very easy and efficient to add more charts to increase functionality. </li>

			<p>This project builds on Assignment 5 by implementing Bootstrap instead of using our own CSS.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Implemented a boostrap theme for the landing page of the DGS system.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This done on the main landing page coming into the DGS system.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Controller/home.php">Click here</a> to view the landing page.</li>
					<li>Using bootstrap for this page allowed me to enhance the look of the page beyond what I could do with CSS.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Updated navigation bars using bootstrap.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on all pages besides the DGS project landing homepage.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Account/account_home.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the new bootstrap navigation bars.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap allowed me to easily make my navigation bars look more professional.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Implemented breadcrumbs on certain views.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on all views that are not home pages, login pages, or the account creation page.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/DGS/overview.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the bootstrap breadcrumbs.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap allowed me to easily implement breadcrumbs to help users find their way back to where they came from.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Changed tables to use bootstrap tables.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented for all tables in the DGS system.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/DGS/overview.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the new bootstrap tables.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap's tables looked a lot less cluttered than mine and I was able to get the data to look how I wanted it to very easily.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Changed buttons to use bootstrap buttons.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on all buttons inside the DGS system.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Account/creation_form.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the new bootstrap buttons.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap's buttons are visually more appealing than the buttons I was using with normal HTML.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Added glyphicons to enhance buttons and other features of the website.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on all buttons inside the DGS system.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Account/creation_form.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the new bootstrap glyphicons.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap's glyphicons allowed me to easily add images to buttons to make functionality more clear. I would have needed to create my own glyphicons in order to do this with regular CSS.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Implemented bootstrap page headers.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on all pages besides the DGS system home page and the DGS overview page.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Account/account_home.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the new bootstrap page headers.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap's page headers use a nicer looking font and underlines the header unlike mine.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Added wells to make certain uneditable data more clear.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on the student form view and student edit form view.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Student/edit_progress_form.php?id=123456&form=1">Click here</a> to view a page containing a bootstrap well.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap's wells allow a more professional background than I would've created with a solid color in CSS.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Implemented bootstrap grids to allow resizing.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on every page of the DGS system.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Account/account_home.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the new bootstrap grids.</li>
					<li>I would not have been able to make my website responsive without the bootstrap grids.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>I would have implemented one last bootstrap component, but I did not feel like my website would have gained much use of the component.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>I implemented bootstrap on all pages of the DGS system, but I did not implement it the webpages for my main website.</p>

			<p>My webpage resizes nicely with the bootstrap grid system implemented. For large displays, I use a 3-6-3 column system. For medium displays, I use a 2-10-2 column display and for small and smaller than small, I use a 0-12-0 column display. This allows the webpages to look nice on all screen sizes.</p>

			<p>This project builds on Assignment 4 by implementing user roles. </p>

			<p>I chose to represent the roster, list of all completed forms for each student, and part of the form using a HTML table styled with CSS. Each webpage has a consistent header and horizontal navigation bar for easy navigation using partials. On the backend, there is a MVC architecture with a MySQL database for holding information.</p>

			<p>Currently a user form can only be modified once per day since I am using the date modified as part of the primary key.</p>

			<p>For testing, I clicked on every link to make sure that it went to the right webpage. I also tested the website on multiple browsers. I then inspected the code through the feature in PhpStorm. I also made sure all of my calculations are accurate and I tested my SQL queries using MySQL Workbench.</p>

			<p>I did not use any references out side of the class materials for this project.</p>

			<p>This project builds on Assignment 3 by allowing user input and storing it into a MySQL database with the MVC architecture to build the website. The controller intercepts the requests into the Grad_Progress directory and uses the model to build an object to display to the view. All of the data in the Grad_Progress system is now being pulled from the MySQL database and new data can be inserted through the website.</p>

			<p>This project builds on Assignment 2 by implementing a MySQL database with the MVC architecture to build the website.

Each webpage has a consistent header and horizontal navigation bar for easy navigation. On the backend, there is a MVC architecture with a MySQL database for holding information.</p>

			<p>Now that we have a database, I removed all of the hard coded information and now query it into the object from the database. I receive conditions for my queries based on the parameters sent via the url.</p>

			<p>For testing, I clicked on every link to make sure that it went to the right webpage. I also tested the website on multiple browsers. I then inspected the code through the feature in PhpStorm.

			<h2>Peer Review</h2>

			<p>For this assignment, I am working with Fumiko Aoki.</p>

			<p>I told her that her website is a little boring since the only color on it is the purple in the navigation bar. I did however tell her that I think her design is very nice and her implementation seems to be very good. I could not find a way to break her website. I also told her that her website is very easy to use. </p>

			<p>Fumiko told me that it would be beneficial for the DGS to view the students on the DGS overview page. Which I have implemented.</p>

			<p>This project builds on Assignment 1 by adding a MVC architecture to build the website. The controller intercepts the requests into the Grad_Progress directory and uses the model to build an object to display to the view.</p>

			<p>I chose to represent the roster, list of all completed forms for each student, and part of the form using a HTML table styled with CSS. Each webpage has a consistent header and horizontal navigation bar for easy navigation. On the backend, there is a MVC architecture.</p>

			<p>Since we do not have a database yet, I hard coded all of the information into each class object. I use if statements to determine which object should be created based off of the id passed in the url.</p>

			<p>For testing, I clicked on every link to make sure that it went to the right webpage. I also tested the website on multiple browsers. I then inspected the code through the feature in PhpStorm. </p>

			<p>I did not reference any external pages for this assignment.</p>
