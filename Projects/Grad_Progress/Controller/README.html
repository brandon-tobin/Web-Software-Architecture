			<p>This project builds on Assignment 5 by implementing Bootstrap instead of using our own CSS.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Implemented a boostrap theme for the landing page of the DGS system.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This done on the main landing page coming into the DGS system.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Controller/home.php">Click here</a> to view the landing page.</li>
					<li>Using bootstrap for this page allowed me to enhance the look of the page beyond what I could do with CSS.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Updated navigation bars using bootstrap.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on all pages besides the DGS project landing homepage.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Account/account_home.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the new bootstrap navigation bars.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap allowed me to easily make my navigation bars look more professional.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Implemented breadcrumbs on certain views.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on all views that are not home pages, login pages, or the account creation page.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/DGS/overview.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the bootstrap breadcrumbs.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap allowed me to easily implement breadcrumbs to help users find their way back to where they came from.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Changed tables to use bootstrap tables.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented for all tables in the DGS system.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/DGS/overview.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the new bootstrap tables.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap's tables looked a lot less cluttered than mine and I was able to get the data to look how I wanted it to very easily.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Changed buttons to use bootstrap buttons.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This was implemented on all buttons inside the DGS system.</li>
					<li><a href="/Projects/Grad_Progress/Account/creation_form.php">Click here</a> to view a page containing the new bootstrap buttons.</li>
					<li>Bootstrap's buttons are visually more appealing than the buttons I was using with normal HTML.</li>

			<p>This project builds on Assignment 4 by implementing user roles. </p>

			<p>I chose to represent the roster, list of all completed forms for each student, and part of the form using a HTML table styled with CSS. Each webpage has a consistent header and horizontal navigation bar for easy navigation using partials. On the backend, there is a MVC architecture with a MySQL database for holding information.</p>

			<p>Currently a user form can only be modified once per day since I am using the date modified as part of the primary key.</p>

			<p>For testing, I clicked on every link to make sure that it went to the right webpage. I also tested the website on multiple browsers. I then inspected the code through the feature in PhpStorm. I also made sure all of my calculations are accurate and I tested my SQL queries using MySQL Workbench.</p>

			<p>I did not use any references out side of the class materials for this project.</p>

			<p>This project builds on Assignment 3 by allowing user input and storing it into a MySQL database with the MVC architecture to build the website. The controller intercepts the requests into the Grad_Progress directory and uses the model to build an object to display to the view. All of the data in the Grad_Progress system is now being pulled from the MySQL database and new data can be inserted through the website.</p>

			<p>This project builds on Assignment 2 by implementing a MySQL database with the MVC architecture to build the website.

Each webpage has a consistent header and horizontal navigation bar for easy navigation. On the backend, there is a MVC architecture with a MySQL database for holding information.</p>

			<p>Now that we have a database, I removed all of the hard coded information and now query it into the object from the database. I receive conditions for my queries based on the parameters sent via the url.</p>

			<p>For testing, I clicked on every link to make sure that it went to the right webpage. I also tested the website on multiple browsers. I then inspected the code through the feature in PhpStorm.

			<h2>Peer Review</h2>

			<p>For this assignment, I am working with Fumiko Aoki.</p>

			<p>I told her that her website is a little boring since the only color on it is the purple in the navigation bar. I did however tell her that I think her design is very nice and her implementation seems to be very good. I could not find a way to break her website. I also told her that her website is very easy to use. </p>

			<p>Fumiko told me that it would be beneficial for the DGS to view the students on the DGS overview page. Which I have implemented.</p>

			<p>This project builds on Assignment 1 by adding a MVC architecture to build the website. The controller intercepts the requests into the Grad_Progress directory and uses the model to build an object to display to the view.</p>

			<p>I chose to represent the roster, list of all completed forms for each student, and part of the form using a HTML table styled with CSS. Each webpage has a consistent header and horizontal navigation bar for easy navigation. On the backend, there is a MVC architecture.</p>

			<p>Since we do not have a database yet, I hard coded all of the information into each class object. I use if statements to determine which object should be created based off of the id passed in the url.</p>

			<p>For testing, I clicked on every link to make sure that it went to the right webpage. I also tested the website on multiple browsers. I then inspected the code through the feature in PhpStorm. </p>

			<p>I did not reference any external pages for this assignment.</p>
